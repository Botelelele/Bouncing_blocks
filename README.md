# Bouncing_blocks
Program takes two numbers as an input - two masses of blocks.
The second one is starting with some velocity moving towards the direction of the first one.
On the left hand side we have a wall preventing those two blocks from running away out of screen.
Every time first block collide with either other one or the wall we count it as a collsion.
When two blocks' masses are properly adjusted the number of collisions gives us digits of PI.
For example ratio of masses 1:1 gives 3 and 1:10 gives 31 and so on...
